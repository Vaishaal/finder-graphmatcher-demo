This package contains the code to run shadow analysis.

Package contents:
   shadow (executable): determines from shadow parameters and latitude the
      possible camera compass orientations
   shadow_calib (executable): determines from camera calibration parameters and
      picked points the shadow parameters
   pixels.py: prints the coordinates of image pixels clicked by user

   shadow_calib.cpp: self-contained source code for shadow_calib
   shadow_main.cpp, shadow.h, shadow.cpp, shadow_util.h, shadow_util.cpp:
      source code for shadow

Binary executables developed and tested on Ubuntu 12.04, tested on Ubuntu 14.04
The python component (pixels.py) relies on the tk package

This code was originally developed with an assumed high degree of user
 involvement, and may require some edits to streamline for script invocation.

As-is pipeline:
   Assume camera calibration parameters roll, tilt, principle point,
      and focal length are given (e.g. from Sun-Chun).
   Open query with pixels.py, click first the shadow tip, then its base, then
      the top of the caster.
   Run shadow_calib and interactively enter the above data.  Final line of
      output is the length ratio and offset angle required by shadow.
   Run shadow, passing latitude and shadow parameters on command line.

In the event of edits to source code, the binaries were compiled with
   (non-essential flags omitted):
$ g++ -o shadow_calib shadow_calib.cpp
$ g++ -o shadow shadow_main.cpp shadow.cpp shadow_util.cpp
